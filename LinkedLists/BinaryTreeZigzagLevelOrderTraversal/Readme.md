# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by T lines, each containing an integer N.

## Constraints

```shell
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```

## Output Format

For each test case, print the number of trailing 0s in N!, separated by new line.

## Sample Input 0

```shell
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

## Sample Output 0

```shell
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```
