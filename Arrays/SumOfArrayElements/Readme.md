Given an array of integers, find the sum of the elements of the given array.
Note: Try to solve this without declaring/storing the array elements.

*Input Format*

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.

*Constraints*

```shell
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e15
```

*Output Format*

For each test case, print the sum of the elements of the array, separated by new line.

*Sample Input 0*

```shell
2
3
5 15 3 
2
70 100 
```

*Sample Output 0*

```shell
23
170
```
